Hello! I am a **first-year Ph.D. student** in Data Science and Analytics at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), advised by **[Prof. Xinlei He](https://xinleihe.github.io/)**.

My research interests are in **AI security & privacy**, with a focus on **vision segmentation models**, **LLMs/VLLMs**, and **image watermarking**. In particular, I study **backdoor attacks** and **jailbreaking** of modern foundation models, as well as **attack/defense** for image watermarking systems.

Before that, I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science from City University of Hong Kong and my B.Sc. in Computer Science (Database Systems) from The University of New South Wales.
