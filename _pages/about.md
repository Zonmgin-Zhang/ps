Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in Data Science and Analytics at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), advised by Prof. Xinlei He. My research focuses on Trustworthy AI, especially AI security and safety.

Before that, I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science from City University of Hong Kong and my B.Sc. in Computer Science (Database Systems) from The University of New South Wales.

Recently, I have been working on adversarial/backdoor attacks and safety evaluation for modern foundation models (e.g., prompt-driven video segmentation and multimodal LLMs).
